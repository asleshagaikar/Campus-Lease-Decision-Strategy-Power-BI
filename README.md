# Campus-Lease-Decision-Strategy-Power-BI
Developed a Power BI report for a post-secondary institution's campus lease decision, analyzing enrolments, FTE growth, EMS demand, and labour outlook. Options included renewing the lease, closing the campus, or relocating to another community. The goal was to provide executives with a data-driven recommendation.

OBJECTIVE-

A post-secondary institution specializing in public safety and emergency services faced a strategic decision as the lease for one of its regional campuses (primarily delivering paramedicine training) was nearing expiration. Options included renewing the lease, closing the campus, or relocating to another community. The goal was to provide executives with a data-driven recommendation.


Data Sources-

Paramedicine Enrolments (2020‚Äì2024) ‚Äì training locations, student regions, enrolments & FTEs
Provincial Labour Market Outlook (2024‚Äì2034) ‚Äì job openings & workforce projections
Provincial Ambulance Service Call Volumes (2016‚Äì2024) ‚Äì emergency medical service demand by region
Regional Place Name Translation ‚Äì mapping support


Tools & Techniques-

Power BI for data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboards
Visualizations: trend analysis, geographic distribution, comparative metrics, KPI cards
Key assumptions documented (on/off campus classification, health regions as demand proxies, call volumes as EMS (Emergency Medical Services) demand indicators, labour outlook as workforce demand)


Key Insights-

üìà Enrollment & FTE Growth: The campus showed the highest enrolment growth in 2024 (+56%) and ranked #2 institution-wide in overall enrolments & FTEs.
üßë‚Äçüéì Student Preference: 80% of students in the region preferred on-campus training, with strong local demand from the surrounding health region.
üöë Emergency Demand: The community ranked 4th province-wide in ambulance call volumes, #1 within its health authority (82% of regional calls).
üíº Labour Market: Projected 18% growth in employed paramedics over the next 10 years; job openings peak in 2026 (+67%).


Recommendation-

‚úÖ Renew the Campus Lease
Preserves momentum from strong enrolments and FTE recovery
Ensures training availability in a high-demand, underserved region
Aligns with future workforce demand and hiring surges
Minimizes operational disruption and relocation costs
Strengthens the institution‚Äôs role in supporting regional public safety
