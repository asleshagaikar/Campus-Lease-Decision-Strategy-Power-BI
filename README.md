# Campus-Lease-Decision-Strategy-Power-BI
Developed a Power BI report for a post-secondary institution's campus lease decision, analyzing enrolments, FTE growth, EMS demand, and labour outlook. Options included renewing the lease, closing the campus, or relocating to another community. The goal was to provide executives with a data-driven recommendation.
